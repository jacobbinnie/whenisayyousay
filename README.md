<h1>WISUS | Official &#39;When I Say You Say&#39; Game</h1>

<h3>This association based game was created over a weekend based on an idea I&#39;d had for the past month. It involves Wordle style addictive game architecture and was built entirely using react.js. You can play the game today at <a href="https://whenisayyousay.com">https://whenisayyousay.com</a></h3>

<h3><br />
<strong>QUICK OVERVIEW</strong></h3>

<h3>Each day, there&#39;s a new word that the user must guess. The user has 5 total guesses to get the word right or they lose their <strong>win streak</strong> (scored at the bottom). The user will be given a single word clue. If the user successfully guesses the correct word, the user will be given the option to share their score with their friends!</h3>
